# Africa Journal Platform - Security Implementation Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the security architecture implemented for the Africa Journal Platform.

## Security Architecture

The security implementation is structured across several key components:

```

## Security Components

### Rate Limiting

Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks and API abuse by limiting the number of requests from a specific IP address within a time window. The implementation uses:

- **Redis** for distributed environments (optional)
- **Tiered rate limits** with different thresholds for various endpoints
- **IP-based tracking** with support for reverse proxies

### Authentication Security

Secure authentication practices include:

- **JWT tokens** with short expiration times
- **Password hashing** using bcrypt with appropriate work factor
- **Refresh tokens** for session management
- **HttpOnly cookies** for token storage

### Input Validation and Sanitization

All user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks:

- **Zod schemas** for type-safe validation
- **HTML sanitization** to prevent XSS attacks
- **Input transformation** to safely handle user-provided content

### Security Headers

Comprehensive security headers are implemented using Helmet.js:

- **Content Security Policy (CSP)** to prevent XSS and data injection
- **HSTS** to enforce HTTPS usage
- **X-Frame-Options** to prevent clickjacking
- **X-Content-Type-Options** to prevent MIME-sniffing

### CSRF Protection

Cross-Site Request Forgery protection is implemented for all state-changing operations:

- **Double-submit cookie pattern**
- **CSRF tokens** required for all POST/PUT/DELETE operations
- **Token rotation** for enhanced security

### Audit Logging

Comprehensive audit logging tracks all security-related events:

- **Database logging** for structured querying
- **File-based logging** as a fallback
- **Sanitized request data** capture for forensic analysis

## Security Best Practices

### API Security

- Input validation for all endpoints
- Resource-based authorization
- Principle of least privilege
- Rate limiting
- HTTPS enforcement

### Data Security

- Encrypted data at rest
- Secure data transmission
- PII protection
- Minimal data retention

### Infrastructure Security

- Updated dependencies
- Regular security audits
- Proper environment segregation
- Monitoring and alerting

## Configuration

Security features can be configured through environment variables:

```env
# General Security
NODE_ENV=production  # Always use 'production' in production environments
COOKIE_SECRET=<strong-random-value>
CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-domain.com

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=<strong-random-value>
JWT_EXPIRATION=15m
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRATION=7d

# Rate Limiting
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW=15  # Window in minutes
RATE_LIMIT_MAX=100    # Max requests per window
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379  # Optional, for distributed rate limiting

# Audit Logging
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

## Testing Security Features

See `src/docs/SECURITY_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions on testing security features.
